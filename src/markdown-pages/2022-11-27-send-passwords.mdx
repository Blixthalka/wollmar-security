Have you ever been in an situation when you are emailing with a customer, and then they want you to send them some sensitive data?
It could be passwords, customer lists, revenue numbers or secret keys etc, and it feels wrong to just email, but you do it anyway.

As you probably know this exposes this information to be intercepted on by an bad actor.
Which is not ideal, and can lead to heavy damage to your company depending on which kind of information is leaked.

Today there exists various solutions that tries to solve this problem.
Many of the lacking a good user experience.
Often both parties have to create an account at the service.
And maybe share encryption keys.
On other you might not need to create an account, but share encryption keys.
Then you still have the same problem.
How do you send these encryption keys to each other?

However our team att Wollmar have over the last months been crafting a beautiful solution for this problem.
A solution that is both secure and easy to use.

Heres how you as a user will be able to share passwords, sensitive files or encryption keys on Wollmar.

1. The sender will have to create an account on [app.wollmar-security.com](app.wollmar-security.com).
2. Sender adds receivers email, phone nr and the secret file/password. And presses send.
3. The receiver will get a link on the email and a one-time code on the phone.
4. The receiver combines them and downloads the secret item.
5. The item is deleted from our servers after 15 min.

This workflow makes it really convenient for the receiver to receive the files.
No account creation is needed.
And the secret item is seemlesly downloaded.

By using two message channels both email and phone, it makes an advesary need to get a hold of both, instead of just one.
This makes it much harder to break.
Also by deleting the secret item after 15 minutes on our server, if an adversary will get a hold of the code and link in the future, it will lead to nowhere.
Which is pretty neat, compared to an email server where the secret can be laying around for a long time and just waiting to be exposed.

Hopefully you will think this provides value and sign up for our waiting list.
